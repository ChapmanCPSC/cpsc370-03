## What is Applica?
Applica gives everyone a chance for education. Applica is an online platform that simplifies the college application process. In the world, people are consistently troubled with the current execution and process for applying to colleges. In the Philippines, this is even more evident, as the application process has been the same for several years. Applicants write the same information over and over again for each college they apply to. Nothing has been done to deal with the the stringent and inconvenient process that these educational institutions offer. What we aim to do is to create a virtual bridge to be able to connect institutions and applicants despite financial and geographical boundaries. Not only will we create a functional and user-friendly application, but we also vow to make it a simple, smooth, and streamlined application system.
